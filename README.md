# PhotoApp

## Introduction

The API provides a catalog service, where the items in the catalog are photos
(accessible via URL) with a short text description (string) and a confidence value
(float). The database already contains 30 items.

## How to run?

You need to add `local.properties` file to the root directory and indicate your api key:

```
apiKey="some-value-here"
```
